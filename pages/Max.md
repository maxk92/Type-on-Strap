## Max

My name is Max and I am an aspiring Data Scientist in the field of sports analytics. I finished my M.Sc. in Exercise Science at the German Sport University Cologne in 2019 and have since worked as a Research Associate at the Institute for [Exercise Science and Computer Science in Sport at the GSU](https://www.dshs-koeln.de/en/institut-fuer-trainingswissenschaft-und-sportinformatik/), pursuing my PhD.
  
In my role as a Research Associate I have carried out research in the fields of exercise science as well as sports analytics. My special interests span the mathematical properties of the game of football as well as methodological concerns in applying Machine Learning and Statistical Modelling to sports data.
  
Next to teaching statistics to sports students, I have collaborated with two colleagues in a project funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research to create Open Educational Resources for teaching Machine Learning foundations to sports students. The resources can be found under the [following link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oobmC7NBB5fx7Se72BYvNDXYgyVRqeM_).
